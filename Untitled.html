			<h2>OUR FOOD</h2>
			<p>
We are an American Bistro featuring bold flavors at affordable prices that are perfect for pairing with our wines. Our full menu including our signature pizzas, soups and salads are available anytime we are open. We feature daily specials, so be sure to ask your server about them. We can also host your special event, such as a bridal shower, anniversary party or club meeting any time or day of the week with our full complement of food and wine service.

				<p>We feature wines from smaller, family owned wineries from locations around the world, such as California, Spain, Argentina and New Zealand. These wineries are smaller, yet offer high-quality lots at great prices exclusively to specialty retail stores like ours. You will not find these wines in your local grocery or liquor stores. We offer these wines by the taste, glass, bottle and case. We also offer a "Wine of the Month Club" featuring wines carefully selected by our professional wine tasters who sample hundreds of new wines every year looking for the perfect combination of flavor, rarity and value. </p>
